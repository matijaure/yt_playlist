# YouTube Playlist

This is a simple webpage that automatically plays YouTube videos from a pre-made list of anime and video game music songs.

It is mainly for personal use, and use on [my stream](https://www.twitch.tv/theonly0) with some special hooks to interact with my stream bot (which is not public code at the moment) and update the scoreboard linked in the bottom-right corner of the page (which is a bad link on this repo). There is a hosted version on firebase that has a database for playlist scores (also not public code), although it is no longer being kept up-to-date due to a change in firebase policies.

It is an example of a webpage using the [Promise Loader](https://github.com/LumenTheFairy/PromiseLoader) (although an admittedly somewhat messy one).

You can view the playlist here: [https://www.theonlyone.games/youtube-playlist/](https://www.theonlyone.games/youtube-playlist/).
